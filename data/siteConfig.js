  authorDescription: `I am a software engineer with previous careers in the financial and property management/construction industries. <br/>
  I have a passion for building, whether its a website, an app, or an addition on my house...  <br/> I take great pride in my work.
  I live in Hawthorne, NJ (30 minutes outside of NYC) and enjoy spending my free time working on DIY projects, gardening, hiking and camping with my family, or reading a good book in my hammock.`,
